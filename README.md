# CipherMaster
A cipher toolset probably usable for something I started making this while reading the "Ghost in the wires" Where there is a small cipher made on every chapter.
So when this tool is dom it will hopefully help to solve all of them.
And in the future more.

TODO...
[ ] Make a cipher class file per cipher... containing a encrypt, decrypt and a bruteforce method if possible.
